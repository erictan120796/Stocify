Stock price prediction is a common yet difficult owing to irregularity in stock prices 
because there are a variety of factors causing this. For novice investor, they might need 
spend lots of time to understand the behavior and movement of stocks even though with 
lots of information observed from stock software tools to make good decision in 
selecting good stock for investment. Instead of predicting the stock price, we are trying 
to classify the stocks into overvalued, undervalued, and fair value so that people could 
invest with lower risk and return with high profit. Long-term investment usually takes 
a long period of time for the stock to mature, therefore selecting a good stock could 
mean a lot to investor to prevent getting no return after a long run of waiting. 
Fundamental and technical analysis along with the aids of machine learning are needed 
in this project to develop a good classifier model. At the end of the project, a web 
application with a user-friendly interface that could provide insight about the stock 
categorization for the user to have better understanding about the criteria that the stock 
is a good or bad stock.
